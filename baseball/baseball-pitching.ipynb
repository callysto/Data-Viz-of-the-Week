    "# Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered about baseball pitching?\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball is a very popular sport, played by children and adults across Central and North America (and elsewhere). In professional baseball, extensive data is collected on games and players, to help players, coaches, and spectators understand who is playing well and what strategies work well to propel a team to the championship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball data is available from many sources. Let's see how we can use this data to explore some aspects of the game of baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The pitcher is a key player in baseball games, in charge of throwing the ball from the pitcher's mound across to home plate, where he or she attempts to strike out the batter. The pitcher can adjust the way the ball is throwing, using various speeds and delivery methods to try to fool the batter into swinging and missing the ball (a strike) or not swinging at a good ball (a called strike). \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, certain pitches have gained popularity for their success in games. you may have heard of some of them: fast balls, curve balls, even change ups and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a diagram from the website https://https://rocklandpeakperformance.com/ showing more types of pitches:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Pitch-Shapes.png\" width= 400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use major league baseball data to learn if there are numerical differences that we can observe between different types of pitches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use scatter plots to characterize these types of pitchs by things like speed and spin on the ball. We will use pie charts (or bars charts) to look at the success rate for earning strikes, as determined by pitch type. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us a firm understanding of how these types of pitches differ. \n",
