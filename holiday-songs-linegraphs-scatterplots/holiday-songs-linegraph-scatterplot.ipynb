    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that helps Grades 5-12 teachers and students grow and develop data literacy skills. We do this by providing a data visualization, like a graph, and asking teachers and students to interpret it. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted using the data science process. The steps of this process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",

    "1. Question - What are we trying to answer?\n",
    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need.\n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data so that you can easily explore it.\n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer our question. This includes creating visualizations.\n",
    "5. Interpret - Explain how the evidence answers our question.\n",

    "#### Which pop songs compete with \"All I want For Christmas is You\" in terms of holiday popularity?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, right around Halloween each year, Christmas decorations start appearing in stores. This is shortly followed by stores playing a small set of Christmas pop songs on a joyous never ending loop. One of the most recognizable Christmas songs that you'll hear in a shopping mall is Mariah Carey's \"All I Want For Christmas is You\". People stuck in retail locations in November and December will definitely hear the same few songs over and over. Hence, we will explore the question *'which pop songs compete with \"All I want For Christmas is You\" in terms of holiday popularity?'* in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different ways to decide what makes a song \"popular\". We will use [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) data. This is a data of Google searches for a given topic. In our case a small collection of popular Christmas pop songs\n"

Because of this, it is very interesting that google searches for *Last Christmas* were higher than *All I Want For Christmas is You* in December 2019.
