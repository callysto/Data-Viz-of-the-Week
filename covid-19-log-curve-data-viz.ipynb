    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that helps Grades 5-12 teachers and students grow and develop data literacy skills. We do this by providing a data visualization, like a graph, and asking teachers and students to interpret it. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted using the data science process. The steps of this process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",

Health autorities noticed [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth) during the first few weeks in which COVID-19 cases were confirmed across Canada.
