# Weekly Data Visualizations

The goal is to create weekly visualizations with [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/), balancing high quality visualizations and short readable code using public datasets.

This means some visualizations won't be perfect, but should be accurate and of good quality. Students and teachers should be able to follow the data exploration while understanding, and hopefully modifying, the code.
