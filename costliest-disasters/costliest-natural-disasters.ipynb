By looking at our data frame above we can tell the last row in the data frame is number 866. The python programming language starts counting at 0 so there are acutally 867 rows deep. We can see the number 866 represent the last row when we ran code to generate a list of all columns as well as the number 866 in the last row of our data frame. This makes sense as the number is the same in both ways. \n",

You can click on the dots that represent specific types of events in the legend to the right and hide particular event categories if you want to change the type of events you are looking at on the visualization. The larger dots also show events that had a larger normalized total cost. The normalized total cost on the x axis is shown in millions of dollars while the insurance payments on the y axis are shown in billions of dollars. \n",

Which events are outside of that range? There are three events in particular that have a much higher cost when compared to the rest of the events. What can you find out from the scatter plot about those particular events? These events all were covered fairly extensively in the news. As an extension to this notebook you could work to do some more research on these events. "
