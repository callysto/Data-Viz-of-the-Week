The color of the dots represents the different types of disaster events; for example tornados are a different color than winter storms. Each type of event is represented seperately in this visualization. If there are several different floods each one is represented by a seperate dot however they are all the same color because they belong to the same category.  You can click on the dots that represent specific types of events in the legend to the right, and hide particular event categories if you want to change the type of events you are looking at on the visualization. The larger dots also show events that had a larger normalized total cost. The normalized total cost on the x axis is shown in millions of dollars while the insurance payments on the y axis are shown in billions of dollars. \n",
