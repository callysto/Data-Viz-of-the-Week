    "In Canada, employment rates among disabled individuals have long been a subject of critical importance, as these rates consistently lag behind those of their non-disabled counterparts. Despite various initiatives and policies aimed at fostering inclusivity in the workforce, disabled individuals continue to encounter significant obstacles in their pursuit of securing meaningful employment opportunities. These challenges encompass a myriad of factors, such as the varying prevalence of disability types across different regions, the influence of age demographics on employment prospects, and the intersectionality with gender-based disparities."

Surprisingly, those with *milder disabilities* do not lag too far behind, with a mean employment rate of 73.6%. However, it is concerning to note that individuals with *severe disabilities* face significant challenges, with the lowest mean employment rate at 44.2%, falling far behind the other two categories.\n",

These individuals often encounter substantial barriers to entry due to the severity of their impairments, which can result in limited access to suitable jobs and necessary workplace accommodations. Despite being individuals who often need financial stability the most, they find themselves grappling with limited employment options."
