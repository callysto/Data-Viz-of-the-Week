    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "The steps of the data analysis process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",

    "1. Question - What are we trying to answer? \n",
    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need. \n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",
    "6. Communicate - Explain how the evidence answers the question.\n",

    "# Question\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the most popular types of Dungeons and Dragons characters to play?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is an incredibly popular table-top roleplaying game (TTRPG), first published in 1974 after being developed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Over the years, it has seen its popularity and sales grow exponentially, as newer editions are released and the game finds wider adoption. As of writing, the current version is 5th Edition, which was released in late 2014, though a newer edition is set for release in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gameplay consists of one player, the Dungeon Master (or DM), describing the setting and interpreting the rules, as other players act out their characters within that world. Often D&D is played without any board, but sometimes groups will use maps and miniature figurines to keep track of the chaos. In either case, every player will have their character sheet and a set of dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game presents an opportunity for players to act out the gameplay, taking on the persona of their character and interacting with the world according to their character's abilities. For a lot of D&D players, creating their character is the most important and most creative aspect of the game, so we can explore what's common (and what isn't) when it comes to character creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Can we determine some of the most popular choices in character building in D&D, and develop a character ourselves?"
