    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that helps Grades 5-12 teachers and students grow and develop data literacy skills. We do this by providing a data visualization, like a graph, and asking teachers and students to interpret it. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted using the data science process. The steps of this process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",

    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need. \n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer our question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Explain how the evidence answers our question. \n",
