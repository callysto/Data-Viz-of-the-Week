    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist.\n",

    "The steps of the data analysis process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",

    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need.\n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it.\n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations.\n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization.\n",
    "6. Communicate - Explain how the evidence answers the question.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Tornados are an extreme weather event that occurs in Canada. The [Northern Tornados Project](https://uwo.ca/ntp/about.html) is a project founded at Western Unviersity in 2017. The projec t aims to better understand the occurance of tornados in Canada to provide more understadning on tornados and to increase the abilty to predict tornados so that the damage to property and danger to humans can be reduced. The Northern Tornados Project has published data they have on the occurence of Tornados in Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more interesting information on how tornados are measured you can [read this article.](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/detection/)\n",

    "### Code \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cells below to import the libraries we need for this project. Libraries are pre-made code that make it easier to analyze our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library that helps us with data analysis, and plotly express is a library that helps us to make visualizations. Requests and json help read the sunset and sunrise data from an external API. If you are not familiar with what an API is or does, it essentially sends information to one party from another. For example, many Twitter bots make use of the Twitter API where twitter sends information these bots may need in order to properly function. Datetime supplies information in regards to manipulating dates and times and tzfpy allows us to find timezone names by supplying longitude and latitude values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without importing these libraries we would have to use much more code to analyze our data and generate visualizations. We import the libraries with abbreviations, or aliases, so that we have less typing to do in each line of our code below.\n"
