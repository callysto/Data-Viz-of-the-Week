    "# Question\n",
    "July 1st, 1867, marks an important date in Canadian history - It is the day of Canadian Concferation. Canadian Confederation joined three British North American provinces into one: the Dominion of Canada. After Confederation, Canada was divided into four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. After 155 years, Canada is now composed of ten provices and three territories. The ten provinces of nowadays was finalized in April 1st, 1999, with the birth of Nunavut. However, *what really happened* between July 1st, 1867 and April 1st, 1999? We would like to break down detailed a timeline outlining events happened throughout Canadian Confederation."
