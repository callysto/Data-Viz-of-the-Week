    "Analyzing food item prices on a global scale holds significant importancce due to its far-reaching implications for individuals, communities, and economies. According to [this](https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sites/agri-food/Canada%27s%20Food%20Price%20Report%202023_Digital.pdf) report on Canada's food prices, total foods increased in price by 10.3%.  Access to affordable and nutritious food is a fundamental human right, and understanding the dynamics of food prices is essential in addressing global challenges such as hunger and poverty. "

For example, if you're looking at the prices of different food items in different countries, these prices might be influenced by various factors such as local economies, currency exchange rates, etc. Normalization could involve converting all prices to a common currency or adjusting them based on a common economic indicator, like GDP per capita, to make the comparisons more reflective of their actual cost."

    "Starting with 2021, it appears that certain items such as *Sugar*, *Salt*, and *Oil* dominate the frequency distribution. Sugar having the highest frequency, would be defined as the *mode*, a mathematical term defining the value that appears most frequently in a given set of data. This observation aligns with expectations, given that these items often serve as foundational staples in various cuisines and diets, making them widely sought after and widely available. \n",

    "Examining the data for the year 1990, a stark contrast emerges as we find only three items represented: *Millet*, *Sorghum*, and *Rice*. This limited diversity could be attributed to several factors. One potential factor is that data collection practices and record-keeping back in the early 1990s might have been less comprehensive compared to contemporary times, resulting in a narrower range of documented food items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the *context* of data greatly impacts what is considered a high frequency or low frequency food item. In the year 1990, millet is considered the most frequent (mode) item in the given dataset with a count of 58. However, if we put this item into the context of the year 2021, it would be considered one of the least frequent food items. This shows us that when dealing with data looking at numbers alone doesn't show the full story - looking at how the numbers fit relative to the data helps us make sense of their significance."

To do this, we're going to filter the data on our specified year and food item. Then, we're going to retrieve the maximum price for each country as each country can have multiple prices of the same item. \n",

To reduce the scattering, let's just take the median-value of each year so that we have easier visualization to work with."
