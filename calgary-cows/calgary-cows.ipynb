    "The [Calgary Stampede](https://www.calgarystampede.com/) is a yearly event in Calgary that blends cowboy culture with an enjoyable carnival atmosphere. Alongside concerts and shows, the Stampede showcases an array of engaging events featuring livestock.  In honor of the Calgary Stampede, Callysto built a data visualization centered around a public art installation highlighting cows in Calgary\n",

    "The [Udderly Art](https://calgaryguardian.com/what-happened-to-all-of-calgarys-painted-cows/) project was undertaken by philanthropists and artists in the year 2000. Organizations purchased the cows and worked with a local artist to decorate it and afterwards the cows were placed throughtout Calgary before being auctioned off. There are a still number of these cows throughout Calgary. Our goal in this data visualization was to visualize where the cows are located. "
